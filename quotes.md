Aristotle offers an alternative logic of classification to the genus/species logic. This  logic is most clearly illustrated by Aristotle's  analysis of  the kinds of souls (1984f: 414b 20â€”415a 13).74 Here, instead of defining  the genus 'soul' and the species of plant, animal, and human souls, Aristotle says that the plant soul is living (or nutritive), the  animal  soul  is living plus sensitive, the human soul is living and sensitive plus rational.75 The kinds  of  souls  form  a  progressive  hierarchy:  'In  every  case  the  lower faculty can exist apart from  the higher, but the higher presupposes those below it' (Hicks  1965: 335).

Animals  lead  for  the most part  a  life  of nature (physis), although in  lesser particulars some are influenced by habit (ethos) as well. Man has reason (logos), in addition, and man only (1984b:1332b 4)
