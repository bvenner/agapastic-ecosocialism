# Pragmatic Socialism:  Growing Towards the Beloved Community

The original title of this repository was "Ecology Society Semiotics", and my original slogan describing this project was "Towards a social and political philosophy that is naturalistic, pragmatic and critical"  The idea was to develop a social philosophy based on pragmaticism, Peirce's development of pragmatism, which in turn was developed from semiotics, Peirce's development of logic.

I've retitled this repository "Pragmatic Socialism" to stress the continuity I now see between Hegel, Marx, Peirce and Dewey.  It no longer seems appropriate to me to give these ideas a new name, but rather emphasize the continuity in their development.  The title was inspired by the notion of Hegel as the "grandfather of pragmatic realism" by Kenneth Westphal.
