# Pragmatic Ecosocialism:  Semiotics, Ecology, Society

Pragmatic ecosocialism is intended to be a public philosophy, combining the best of pragmatism and Marxism.  It understands both traditions as building from Hegel, particularly 'left-Hegelianism'.  

It should build upon the work of Erik Olin Wright, who's book *Imagining Real Utopias* was implicitly pragmatist in orientation and explicitly Marxist in theory.

Some arguments for "pragmatic ecosocialism" are below.

The name "pragmatic ecosocialism" was inspired by the notion of Hegel as the "grandfather of pragmatic realism" by Kenneth Westphal.  There is still the one-to-one mapping of concepts - pragmatism = semiotics, ecocialism = ecology society, and I'm using the reordered triplet as a subtitle.  One benefit to this order is that it corresponds with Hegel's ordering of logic, nature, spirit.

Another reason to like the term is the parallel with *pragmatic realism*, a term that was used by Westphal in his book *Grounds of Pragmatic Realism* [@Westphal:2017:Grounds] on Hegel and Olesky's book *Realism and Individualism* [@Olesky:2015:Realism] on Peirce.  Although I haven't read Westphal's book yet, Westphal's other papers describe Hegel as a *holist* and the last chapter of Olesky's book focuses on the social dimensions of this theory.  Both views are contrary to individualism, which is a major metaphysical commitment of neoliberalism.  

Although I still believe that *semiotics* is the appropriate term to describe Peirce's philosophy, the term *pragmatism* is both more well known and also traditionally includes Dewey and Mead, who I have not yet read but are certaintly on the must-read list.  It's also a better marketing term - it modifies the more radical *ecosocialism*.

Now the best reason to be an ecosocialist is that they have the best slogan - *system change not climate change*.

# Some Previous Ideas

## Agapastic Ecosocialism
I had retitled this repository "Agapastic Ecosocialism" to stress the continuity that I now see exists between Hegel, Marx, Peirce and Royce.  It no longer seems appropriate to me to give these ideas a new name, but rather emphasize the continuity in their development.  Because I would like to keep to Peirce's division of philosophy into three aspects:  phenomenology, normative science and metaphysics, it seems appropriate to borrow a strong term from Peirce's metaphysical writings.  

I've gone back and forth on this name (as opposed to actually writing anything), but I'm thinking now that the wider use of the term 'pragmatic' is a positive one.  The 'pragmatic turn' described by Bernstein in contemporary philosophy gives a wide range of thinkers a pragmatic gloss.  Bernstein looks for commonalities between pragmatists and Dewey's wrote on 'radical democracy,' and pragmatism was the official philosophy of the progressive era.  

Ansell develops 'pragmatist democracy', which discusses the transformation of the administrative state to a more problem-solving orientation.  This seems pretty neoliberal as a frame, but it has the advantage of starting from the bureaucracy, something that I'm quite familiar with.  It seems possible to extend this framing to democratic planning. 

## Semiotics, Ecology, Society

The original title of this repository was "Ecology Society Semiotics", and my original slogan describing this project was "Towards a social and political philosophy that is naturalistic, pragmatic and critical"  The idea was to develop a social philosophy based on pragmaticism, Peirce's development of pragmatism, which in turn was developed from semiotics, Peirce's development of logic.
