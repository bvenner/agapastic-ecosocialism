# Agapastic Ecosocialism:  Semiotics, Ecology, Society

The original title of this repository was "Ecology Society Semiotics", and my original slogan describing this project was "Towards a social and political philosophy that is naturalistic, pragmatic and critical"  The idea was to develop a social philosophy based on pragmaticism, Peirce's development of pragmatism, which in turn was developed from semiotics, Peirce's development of logic.

I've retitled this repository "Agapastic Ecosocialism" to stress the continuity that I now see exists between Hegel, Marx, Peirce and Royce.  It no longer seems appropriate to me to give these ideas a new name, but rather emphasize the continuity in their development.  Because I would like to keep to Peirce's division of philosophy into three aspects:  phenomenology, normative science and metaphysics, it seems appropriate to borrow a strong term from Peirce's metaphysical writings.  

A previous renaming was "Pragmatic Ecosocialism".  Although I still like this name, I believe that it makes sense to more clearly mark this as a metaphysical effort.

Some arguments for "pragmatic ecosocialism" are below.

The name "pragmatic ecosocialism" was inspired by the notion of Hegel as the "grandfather of pragmatic realism" by Kenneth Westphal.  There is still the one-to-one mapping of concepts - pragmatism = semiotics, ecocialism = ecology society, and I'm using the reordered triplet as a subtitle.  One benefit to this order is that it corresponds with Hegel's ordering of logic, nature, spirit.

Another reason to like the term is the parallel with *pragmatic realism*, a term that was used by Westphal in his book *Grounds of Pragmatic Realism* [@Westphal:2017:Grounds] on Hegel and Olesky's book *Realism and Individualism* [@Olesky:2015:Realism] on Peirce.  Although I haven't read either book yet, Westphal's other papers describe Hegel as a *holist* and the last chapter of Olesky's book focuses on the social dimensions of this theory.  Both views are contrary to individualism, which is a major metaphysical commitment of neoliberalism.  

Although I still believe that *semiotics* is the appropriate term to describe Peirce's philosophy, the term *pragmatism* is both more well known and also traditionally includes Dewey and Mead, who I have not yet read but are certaintly on the must-read list.  It's also a better marketing term - it modifies the more radical *ecosocialism*.

Now the best reason to be an ecosocialist is that they have the best slogan - *system change not climate change*.
